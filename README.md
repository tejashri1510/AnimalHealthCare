# 🧠 Disease Prediction Model (Animal Health AI)

Welcome to the **Disease Prediction Model**, an intelligent machine learning-based system designed to predict possible diseases in animals based on symptoms submitted by users. This model is integrated into the **PraniSakha** platform to assist vets and users in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Predicts animal diseases based on symptom input.
- ✅ Uses a trained machine learning model.
- ✅ Can be integrated into full-stack applications (e.g., MERN).
- ✅ Fast and scalable inference using `predict.py`.
- ✅ Easily extendable with new symptom/disease data.

## 🧪 Example Usage

**1. Train the Model (if needed):**
```bash
python model.py
2. Predict Disease using Symptoms:



python app.py --symptoms "loss of appetite, vomiting, fatigue"
OR use via API integration in your web app.

💡 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Scikit-learn 🤖

Pandas & NumPy

Joblib for model serialization

📦 Installation
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):



python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
Install dependencies:



pip install -r requirements.txt
📁 Files to Track in Git
Make sure your .gitignore excludes the following:

Lib/, Scripts/, Include/ (system folders inside virtual environments)

__pycache__/

.ipynb_checkpoints/

Any .exe or large binary auto-generated files

🔮 Future Improvements
Integrate deep learning for complex symptom patterns

Expand symptom-disease dataset

Web-based interface for non-technical users

Confidence score in predictions
